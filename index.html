    <h1>JavaScript For Web Designers</h1>

    <p>In all fairness, I should start this book
            with an apology—not to you, reader, though I
            don’t doubt that I’ll owe you at least one by
            the time we get to the end. I owe JavaScript a
            number of apologies for the things I’ve said
            to it during the early years of my career,
            some of which were strong enough to etch
            glass.
    </p>

    <p>This is my not-so-subtle way of saying that
            JavaScript can be a tricky thing to learn.
    </p>
